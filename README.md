# The_Vband
IIT-K Research Project

I worked on designing a prototype for a wrist-band under K.S. Venkatesh, Professor at IIT-K based on sub-sonic principle i.e. any speed lower than the speed of sound within a sound-propagating medium, testing were done accordingly and the working was also successful.
